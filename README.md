# Django Personalized Views with Face Authentication

This project integrates a SpringBoot application for face authentication, an AWS Lambda function for image processing, and a Django application for displaying personalized user dashboards.

## Overview

- The **SpringBoot application** prompts users to upload a facial image for authentication.
- The **AWS Lambda function** processes the uploaded image and uses Amazon Rekognition to authenticate the user.
- The **Django application** displays a personalized dashboard with user details and transaction records once the user is authenticated.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites:

- Python (Version x.x.x recommended)
- Django (Version x.x.x recommended)
- Java (Version x.x.x recommended)
- SpringBoot (Version x.x.x recommended)
- AWS CLI and AWS SAM CLI

### Installation Steps:

1. **Django Setup**:
   - Navigate to the Django project directory.
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies. (Note: Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file).
   - Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
   - Start the server: `python manage.py runserver`

2. **SpringBoot Setup**:
   - Navigate to the SpringBoot directory.
   - Use Maven or Gradle commands to build and run the application, e.g., `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

3. **AWS Lambda**:
